# My waybar and eww configs

I use waybar for the system tray and hyprland workspaces and eww for the rest. The main reason I use eww is to put icons in a different container and control their position separately -- otherwise, they tend to be aligned to the bottom of "regular" text and look slightly off. I couldn't figure out how to do the same in waybar.
